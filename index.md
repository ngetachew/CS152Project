## Sentiment Analysis of AI Articles

I would like to train a neural network to perform a sentiment analysis on articles on the topic of artificial intelligence. As my career in CS has progressed, I've had numerous conversations with friends and peers (both in and out of CS) about the future of artifical intelligence, and I've heard a wide range of view points. Movies like Terminator and Ex Machina have propogated the perception that AI is somehow going to destroy the world. When I first learned about machine learning and neural networks, I found these ideas laughable because in my mind, there was no way that these formulas and math processes could eventually lead to something like Skynet. Now however, we see AI being the source of major societal conflicts like misinformation echo-chambers and deep fakes. AI is providing an increasing number solutions to many problems, but like we talked about in our ethics discussion, it's bringing about numerous problems with it. Ideally, a model that could perform sentiment analysis could provide a lot of insight into what public perceptions on AI are right now and even provide a way of measuring its change in the future.  

Sentiment analysis can be thought of as a way of extracting the "mood" around a given topic(positive, negative, neutral). This done using natural language processing libraries and neural networks. There are lots of articles and papers about sentiment analysis around the internet, so there would be plenty of resources to help with developing the model. The most significant problem would be getting good data. I found a nice [API](https://newsapi.org/) that gets news articles from keywords and I'm sure there are plenty of others, but otherwise it would be possible to manually scrape data from news websites.
